SeaVoX Sampling and Observation Platform Event Actions

Terms used to identify actions performed on sampling and observation platforms. This vocabulary is the result of an harmonisation exercise between the Eurofleets Automatic Reporting System (EARS) ontology and the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) project, for research vessel event logs. The terms it contains should be applicable to any sampling or observation platforms.
